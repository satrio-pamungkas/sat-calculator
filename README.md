[![Package version](https://badge.fury.io/py/uvicorn.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/sat-calculator/)

**Requirements**: Python 3.7+ 

**Sat Calculator** is just an ordinary calculator which is being used as initial experiment to publish my first package to PyPi. Nothing special with this library/package in term of feature. If you need more features, go to other packages that available widely. This package will unlikely have updated in the future

---

## Quickstart
Already stated before, you can install this package via PIP :
```shell
$ pip install sat-calculator
```

To run the program without involving with coding, run this command :
```shell
$ calculate
```
